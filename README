ledgerweb v0.0

To run:
>ruby ledgerweb.rb
then point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:4567/force.html


v0.0 release notes
- Depends on a custom libledger.so for python bindings 
	(same as libledger.a, but linked as a dynamic lib and with a few hacks added to fix bugs in the python support)
- The example page, force.html is essentially just a few modifications on top of the force directed layoout example from D3
- The size of the graphics do not scale at all so a more realistic sample data would not fit in the display window
- Edge cases when drilling down past the smallest sub account are not handled correctly.
